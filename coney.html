        <p>Standing 150 feet tall, it has been a centerpiece of the boardwalk skyline since its debut in 1920.</p>
        <p>Coney Island has been a hub of seaside amusement for more than a century, known for its thrilling rides,
            bright lights, and summertime energy. From the historic Cyclone roller coaster to modern attractions, it
